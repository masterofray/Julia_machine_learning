# WELL-ORGANIZED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

### Directory Structure
1. **Root Directory**: This is the main directory where your `README.md` file will reside.
2. **src**: This directory will contain all your Julia source code files.
3. **notes**: This directory will hold your daily notes.
4. **examples**: If the book includes example projects or exercises, you can store them here.
5. **docs**: This directory can be used for any additional documentation.

### Example Structure
```
/MyJuliaLearningRepo
│
├── README.md
├── src
│   ├── chapter1
│   ├── chapter2
│   └── ...
│
├── notes
│   ├── day1.md
│   ├── day2.md
│   └── ...
│
├── examples
│   ├── example1
│   ├── example2
│   └── ...
│
└── docs
    └── additional_resources.md
```

### README.md
This file should provide an overview of your repository, explaining the purpose and structure, and how others can navigate through it.

### Daily Notes
To make daily notes:
1. Create a markdown file for each day in the `notes` directory.
2. Use a consistent naming convention, such as `day1.md`, `day2.md`, etc.
3. In each markdown file, note the date, the pages covered, key concepts learned, and any code snippets or examples.

### Example of a Daily Note (`day1.md`)
```markdown
# Day 1 - [Date]

## Pages Covered
- Pages 1 to 20

## Key Concepts
- Introduction to Julia
- Basic Syntax
- Variables and Types

## Notes
- Julia is designed for high-performance numerical and scientific computing.
- Syntax is concise and readable.
- Julia has dynamic typing but can also be used in a statically-typed manner.

## Code Snippets
```julia
# Example of defining a variable
x = 10
println(x)

# Basic arithmetic
y = x + 5
println(y)
```

## Steps to Create and Update the Repository
1. **Initialize the Repository**: Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyJuliaLearningRepo.git
   ```
3. **Create the Directory Structure**: Manually create the directories or use the command line.
   ```bash
   mkdir -p MyJuliaLearningRepo/{src,notes,examples,docs}
   ```
4. **Add and Commit Changes**: After creating your directories and adding files, commit your changes.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with directory structure"
   git push origin main
   ```
5. **Update Daily**: Each day, add your new notes and any code you’ve written, then commit and push the changes.
   ```bash
   git add notes/dayX.md src/chapterX/*
   git commit -m "Added notes and code for Day X"
   git push origin main
   ```
