# Day 1 - 20240731

## Pages Covered
- Pages 24 to 44 [julia for beginners]

## Key Concepts
- Some keyword in Julia that already or not in python
- Julia's Array
- Higher Order functions (HOF)
- Loopings
- Conditional Expression
- Working with text

## Notes
- Different print vs println
- Function like lambda
- String is only using double quote (""). Single quote is only for a character.
- For vector, array can be used like this : `x =  [1, 2, 3]`. For Matrix, array will form like this : `x = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]`, separated by white space.
- Higher Order function is functions which take other functions as arguments. So `map` is a higher-order function, while sum isn't Higher-order functions will be covered more in detail in Functional Programming. Keyword is using `map`.
- Looping keyword still use `for ... end`.
- Conditional still use `if ... elif ... else ... end`

## Code Snippets
- look into the src code
